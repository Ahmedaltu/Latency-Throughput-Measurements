# Latency-Throughput-Measurements

# Network Measurements Project (Latency + Throughput)

This repository contains the full implementation for:
- Basic latency measurements (ICMP + TCP connect + DNS query time)
- Throughput measurements (TCP throughput using iperf3)

Measurements were collected using:
- **Ubuntu 22.04 VM** (user: `***`)
- **Aalto Linux server `lyta`** (user: `***`)
